A lightweight password manager built with **Python** and **Tkinter**.
I created this project because I just wanted my own free app, nothing fancy, just something that works reliably.

* If the file doesn’t exist, it will be created automatically.
* No cloud storage, no third-party services, your data stays on your machine.

## 💡 Why I Built This

I didn’t want to rely on paid apps or cloud-based managers.
This project is a small, personal tool:

* Not meant to be fancy
* Not packed with features
* Just works when you need it
